# Run the Configuration Processor
#
# We assemble a scratch working area, putting the site configuration
# and the CP's persistent state into it.
#
# Then the configuration processor is invoked.
#
# If all runs to completion, then we tentatively save the
# CP output prior to using it in a deployment.
