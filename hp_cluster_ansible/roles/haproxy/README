Include:
  - tls-frontend - to install server certs
  - haproxy - for load balancing

Pre-reqs:
  - haproxy user     - may be installed by haproxy package
  - haproxy group    - may be installed by haproxy package

Questions/Comments:
  - If chroot is used how to log to syslog and access stats socket
  - Is it necessary to be able to run more than one instance of haproxy
  - logging will need to be done to somewhere compatible with central logging

TODO: Fix race in haproxy startup. Need to sleep somewhere - it is being
restarted too soon.

TODO: mysql roundrobin or leastconn? helion 1.0 has roundrobin, but I thought
leastconn suited replication best.

TODO: create certificate on each node having stunnel. The certificate should
be for the VIP associated with the IP-cluster and not a specific machine. This
means the certificate should be created on the ansible machine and copied to
all machines in the cluster. The credentials are currently hard-coded -
fix them.


v2 Input specific notes:

A service can specify vip-check as (a mysql example)

    vip-check: check port 9200 inter 12000 rise 3 fall 3

If not, a default string will be used.

    vip-check: check inter 12000 rise 3 fall 3

Service healthchecks:

The vars.healthcheck is deprecated. A service can specify healthcheck
in vip-options input.

Eg:
    endpoints:
    -   port: '80'
        has-vip: true
        vip-options:
        - "option httpchk GET /"
        - "stick on src"
        - "stick-table type ip size 200k expire 30m"
        roles:
        - public

If a service doesn't specify vip-options, a default healthcheck will
be added.

  "option httpchk GET /"

If a service doesn't want a healthcheck it needs to make this intent
explicit by having a vip-options in the input. It could be empty if
the service doesn't need any options at all.

  endpoints:
    -   port: '6080'
        has-vip: true
        vip-options:
        roles:
        - public

The haproxy globals and defaults are now also configurable from the
defaults in the haproxy role.
