# Return a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state
#
# if rabbitmq_reset_option=reset (the default), this removes the node from
# any cluster it belongs to, removes all data from the mnesia database, such
# as configured users and vhosts, and deletes all persistent messages.
#
# If rabbitmq_reset_option=force_reset, it totally resets the state.
#
# For this command to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been
# stopped. If the reset fails due to the timeout the cluster is generally
# unrecoverable.
