# HLM-1484 Sending options=persistent to a node that is in UEFI mode
# will cause it to switch to Legacy BIOS on its next reset. We don't
# want that to happen, so send it options=efiboot to tell it that it's
# it's OK to stay in UEFI mode. Despite its name, this option means
# "stay in whatever boot mode you're in" so it is safe to send to
# Legacy nodes also i.e. it will not switch them to UEFI.
# Some older iLOs don't support this flag and will return an error.
