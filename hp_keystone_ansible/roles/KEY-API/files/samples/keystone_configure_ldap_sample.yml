      #  2. LDAP is only supported for identity operations (reading users and groups from LDAP). Assignment
      #     operations with LDAP (i.e. managing roles, projects) are not supported.
      #  3. LDAP is configured as non-default domain. Configuring LDAP as a default domain is not supported.
